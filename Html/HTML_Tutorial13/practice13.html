	::REMINDER::
	
	Art direction: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts — for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in close for a mobile layout. This can be solved using the <picture> element.
	
	Resolution switching: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and also optionally that you want to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. This can be solved using vector graphics (SVG images), and the srcset and sizes attributes.
